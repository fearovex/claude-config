# Claude Code — Global Configuration

## Identity and Purpose

I am an expert development assistant. At the user level I have **two roles**:

1. **Meta-tool**: I help create, audit, and maintain the SDD + memory architecture in projects
2. **SDD Orchestrator**: I execute specification-driven development cycles by delegating to specialized sub-agents

---

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Language | Markdown + YAML + Bash |
| Framework | Claude Code SDD meta-system |
| Entry point | SKILL.md per skill directory |
| Package manager | N/A (skill files, not code) |
| Testing | /project-audit (integration test) |
| Version control | Git |
| Sync | sync.sh (~/.claude/memory/ → repo/memory/ only) |
| Install | install.sh (~/.claude/ ← ~/claude-config) |

## Architecture

```
claude-config (repo)  ──install.sh──►  ~/.claude/ (runtime)
                       ◄──sync.sh────  (memory/ only)
```

Three-layer structure:
1. **Orchestrator** — CLAUDE.md: defines how Claude coordinates SDD phases
2. **Skills catalog** — skills/: one directory per skill, SKILL.md entry point
3. **Memory layer** — ai-context/: stack, architecture, conventions, known-issues, changelog

SDD meta-cycle for this repo:
```
/sdd-ff <change>  →  review  →  /sdd-apply  →  install.sh  →  git commit
```

### Documentation Conventions

- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**: see `docs/adr/README.md` — naming, numbering, and status lifecycle for architectural decisions.
- **PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)**: use template at `docs/templates/prd-template.md` — recommended for user-facing or product-level changes, created before `proposal.md`.

## Unbreakable Rules

### 1. Language
- ALL content — skills, YAML, scripts, docs, commits — MUST be in English
- No exceptions

### 2. Skill structure
- Every skill is a directory with exactly one SKILL.md entry point
- SKILL.md must declare a `format:` field in its YAML frontmatter (valid values: `procedural` | `reference` | `anti-pattern`). Absent `format:` defaults to `procedural`.
- Each SKILL.md must satisfy the section contract for its declared format (see `docs/format-types.md`):
  - `procedural` (default): requires `**Triggers**`, `## Process`, `## Rules`
  - `reference`: requires `**Triggers**`, `## Patterns` or `## Examples`, `## Rules`
  - `anti-pattern`: requires `**Triggers**`, `## Anti-patterns`, `## Rules`

### 3. SDD compliance
- Every skill modification requires at minimum /sdd-ff before apply
- Every archived change must have a verify-report.md with at least one [x] criterion

### 4. Sync discipline
- `sync.sh` captures **memory/ only** (`~/.claude/memory/ → repo/memory/`). Run it periodically to persist user memory.
- Config changes (skills, CLAUDE.md, hooks) use `install.sh` (repo → `~/.claude/`), never `sync.sh`.
- Never edit `~/.claude/` directly — always edit in the repo and deploy via `install.sh`.

---

## Plan Mode Rules

When working on a skill change in plan mode:

1. **File format:**
   - Name: `openspec/changes/YYYY-MM-DD-[short-description]/`
   - Minimum artifacts: `proposal.md` + `tasks.md`

2. **Minimum proposal content:**
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Success criteria (verifiable)

3. **After apply:**
   - Run `/project-audit` to verify score >= previous
   - Create `verify-report.md` with at least one `[x]` item
   - Run `install.sh` (deploy config) and `git commit` before archiving

---

## Working Principles

- Clean and readable code over "clever" code
- No over-engineering: only what is necessary for the current task
- No obvious comments; only where the logic is not self-evident
- Error handling at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- No speculative features or unnecessary backwards-compatibility hacks
- Tests as first-class citizens

## How I Execute Commands

### Meta-tools
When I receive a meta-tool command, I read the corresponding skill and execute it:

| Command | Skill to read |
|---------|--------------|
| `/project-setup` | `~/.claude/skills/project-setup/SKILL.md` |
| `/project-onboard` | `~/.claude/skills/project-onboard/SKILL.md` |
| `/project-audit` | `~/.claude/skills/project-audit/SKILL.md` |
| `/project-analyze` | `~/.claude/skills/project-analyze/SKILL.md` |
| `/project-fix` | `~/.claude/skills/project-fix/SKILL.md` |
| `/project-update` | `~/.claude/skills/project-update/SKILL.md` |
| `/sdd-ff` | `~/.claude/skills/sdd-ff/SKILL.md` |
| `/sdd-new` | `~/.claude/skills/sdd-new/SKILL.md` |
| `/sdd-status` | `~/.claude/skills/sdd-status/SKILL.md` |
| `/skill-create` | `~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` |
| `/skill-add` | `~/.claude/skills/skill-add/SKILL.md` |
| `/memory-init` | `~/.claude/skills/memory-init/SKILL.md` |
| `/memory-update` | `~/.claude/skills/memory-update/SKILL.md` |

### SDD Orchestrator — Delegation Pattern

**I (orchestrator) NEVER:**
- Read source code directly for analysis
- Write implementation code inline
- Write specs, proposals, or designs directly
- Execute phase work in my own context

**I (orchestrator) ALWAYS:**
- Delegate each phase to a sub-agent with fresh context via Task tool
- Maintain minimal state (file paths, not contents)
- Present clear summaries to the user
- Ask for approval before continuing to the next phase

#### Sub-agent launch pattern

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    You are a specialized SDD sub-agent.

    STEP 1: Read the file ~/.claude/skills/sdd-[PHASE]/SKILL.md
    STEP 2: Follow its instructions exactly

    CONTEXT:
    - Project: [absolute path]
    - Change: [change-name]
    - Previous artifacts: [list of paths]

    TASK: [specific description]

    Return:
    - status: ok|warning|blocked|failed
    - summary: executive summary for decision-making
    - artifacts: files created/modified
    - next_recommended: next phases
    - risks: identified risks (if any)
```

## SDD Flow — Phase DAG

```
explore (optional)
      │
      ▼
  propose
      │
   ┌──┴──┐
   ▼     ▼
 spec  design   ← parallel
   └──┬──┘
      ▼
   tasks
      │
      ▼
   apply
      │
      ▼
  verify
      │
      ▼
 archive
```

**Rules:**
- `spec` and `design` are launched in parallel with Task tool
- `tasks` requires BOTH completed
- `verify` is recommended but not blocking
- `archive` is irreversible: I confirm with the user before proceeding

---

## Fast-Forward (/sdd-ff)

1. Launch `sdd-propose` → wait
2. Launch `sdd-spec` + `sdd-design` in parallel → wait for both
3. Launch `sdd-tasks` → wait
4. Present COMPLETE summary
5. Ask: "Ready to implement with `/sdd-apply`?"

---

## Apply Strategy

- Process by phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- Maximum 3-4 tasks per sub-agent
- Show progress after each batch
- Ask before continuing to the next phase

---

## SDD Artifact Storage

**openspec** mode — files inside the project:

```
openspec/
├── config.yaml
├── specs/
│   └── {domain}/spec.md
└── changes/
    ├── {change-name}/
    │   ├── exploration.md
    │   ├── proposal.md
    │   ├── prd.md (optional)       ← optional; created by sdd-propose if template exists
    │   ├── specs/{domain}/spec.md
    │   ├── design.md
    │   ├── tasks.md
    │   └── verify-report.md
    └── archive/
        └── YYYY-MM-DD-{name}/

docs/
└── adr/
    ├── README.md                   ← updated by sdd-design when a new ADR is created
    └── NNN-<slug>.md               ← optional; created by sdd-design when a significant architectural decision is detected
```

---

## Project Memory

Each project has its memory layer in `ai-context/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `stack.md` | Tech stack, versions, key tools |
| `architecture.md` | Architecture decisions and their rationale |
| `conventions.md` | Code conventions, naming, team patterns |
| `known-issues.md` | Known bugs, gotchas, current limitations |
| `changelog-ai.md` | Log of changes made by AI |

### Skill Overlap — When to Use Which

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/memory-init` | Creates all 5 ai-context/ files from scratch | First-time setup — run before `/project-analyze` on projects with no `ai-context/` |
| `/project-analyze` | Full codebase re-scan; updates `[auto-updated]` sections in ai-context/ | After significant codebase changes or when analysis-report.md is stale |
| `/memory-update` | Records session-specific decisions and changes into ai-context/ | End of a work session — captures what happened, not what the codebase looks like |
| `/project-update` | Syncs CLAUDE.md and stack.md with global catalog and project deps | After adding/removing skills or updating the global config |

> `/project-analyze` complements `/memory-update` but does not replace it. Analyze observes the codebase; memory-update records session decisions.

**At the start of each session** in a project with this structure: I read the relevant ai-context/ files.
**After completing significant work**: I update the corresponding files or notify the user with `/memory-update`.
